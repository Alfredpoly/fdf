# What I learned

- How to use the minilibx library
- How to project a 3D point to a 2D point
- How to draw a line between two points

This project is one of my favorite projects at 42. I learned a lot about graphics and I really enjoyed working on it.
Math is what i like to have in a project, and this one is full of it. It reminded me of my high school days when i was learning about vectors and matrices.
